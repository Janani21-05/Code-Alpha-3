Task-3(Artificial Intelligence Chatbot)

Overview of the Project:-

The **Simple Chatbot** is a basic Java application designed to simulate a conversational interface. It provides users with a simple way to interact with a chatbot that can respond to certain keywords. Here’s an overview of its features and functionality:

### Features

1. **User Interaction**: 
   - The chatbot starts with a greeting and prompts the user for input.
   - The conversation continues until the user types "exit," at which point the chatbot bids farewell.

2. **Keyword-Based Responses**: 
   - The chatbot can recognize specific keywords in user input, such as "hello" and "help," and responds appropriately.
   - For inputs that do not match any predefined keywords, it provides a generic response indicating uncertainty.

3. **Looped Input Handling**: 
   - The program uses a `while` loop to continuously accept user input, allowing for ongoing interaction.

4. **Case Insensitivity**: 
   - The chatbot’s responses are case-insensitive, making it more user-friendly.

### Code Structure

- **Main Method**: The entry point of the program where user interaction begins. It initializes the scanner for input and contains the main conversation loop.

- **processInput Method**: A helper method that processes user input. It checks for keywords and returns corresponding responses based on recognized phrases.

### User Experience

The chatbot provides a simple and straightforward interaction model, making it easy for users to engage in conversation. The responses are designed to be friendly and supportive, enhancing the user experience.

### Overall Summary

The Simple Chatbot serves as a foundational project for understanding basic natural language processing and interaction design in Java. It illustrates key concepts such as user input handling, string processing, and response generation in a conversational setting, making it a suitable project for beginners looking to learn about chatbot development.
